## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a dedicated Civil and Environmental Engineering student at Cornell University with strong interests in structural design and sustainable infrastructure. My academic and project experiences reflect a commitment to addressing pressing environmental challenges while developing resilient and efficient engineering solutions. I am particularly drawn to the intersection of civil and environmental systems—whether it’s designing structures that balance safety and innovation or exploring sustainable approaches to water and energy. With a background that combines technical problem-solving, hands-on teamwork, and research experience, I aim to contribute to projects that advance both community resilience and environmental responsibility.
